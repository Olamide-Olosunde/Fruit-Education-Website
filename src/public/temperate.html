        <p>Temperate fruits are grown in regions with distinct seasons—cold winters and mild summers—typically found in areas that lie between the tropics and the polar circles. These fruits tend to thrive in moderate climates, where temperatures vary significantly throughout the year, with the growing season typically lasting from spring to fall. Unlike tropical fruits, which are grown in warmer, year-round climates, temperate fruits often go through a period of dormancy in winter.</p>
